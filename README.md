# Randomized Subspace k-means presentation
This is a presentation about Randomized Subspace k-means, an extension of the original [SubKmeans](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/towards-an-optimal-subspace-for-k-means) algorithm. This extension replaces the eigenvalue decomposition in the original algorithm with a randomized eigenvalue decomposition from the [fbpca](https://github.com/facebook/fbpca) library. This modification results in an order of magnitude improvement in runtime. 

This work was presented at IEEE GlobalSIP 2019.
